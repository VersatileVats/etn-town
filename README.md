# ETN Town

This is the code repository that is responsible for making the project a reality. The **etn.js** file is mainly responsible for doing all of the interactions with the ETN chain via the Metamask extension. The extension helped in onboarding the user in the smoothest manner possible, and then spending ETN for purchasing some assets like **hints & songs** and those ETN are deposited in the **admin ETN wallet**.

The other thing is **"sending ETN from user's account"** to the admin account needed an **Ankr RPC server** that can do that, and is being done by the other code repository which can be found here: https://github.com/VersatileVats/etn-town-ankr-server
